A warm and friendly atmosphere that you would expect from your local, but with the lively buzz and intensity of an authentic Dublin city pub. If you choose to sit or stand outside you can people-watch with a warm toasty and the best Guinness in the world. Grogans is one of those places that time stands still and where the world passes by. Grogans is Liam Gallagher of Oasis favourite pub to visit when in Dublin.<br /><br />•Slattery’s (Capel St.) - Anthony Bourdain recommends the full Irish breakfast here.

It's chilled, it's lively, it's often gritty and it's home to tons of art, design and music studios. <br />It's a lovely piece of old Dublin, the neighbourhood having been constructed in 1923 on a field that was once used for drying and hanging the textiles of the cotton industry, hence the name, The Tenters. In some ways it feels like it's far away from the city, it's so calm. There's a great mix of people living in the area, from artists and actors to the typical Dublin 'aul wans', and plenty of funky cafes and proper old Dublin pubs just a short walk away.

It was where I wanted to live as a DCU student in the late nineties, instead of the gentler, more refined environs of Drumcondra where I was instead. Phibsborough was where the cool kids hung out, with an ice rink, a surfeit of charity shops and good pubs like The Hut, where the Johnny Cash Appreciation Society were in situ on a Sunday night. And then there was McGowan’s, where young love was almost certainly guaranteed to bloom, especially after a few drinks.<br />Fast forward to now and Phibsboro (or Phibsborough – both spellings are considered perfectly acceptable) retains much of the charm that made it so attractive back then.

Dubliners who’ve lived here their whole lives now mingle with trendy newcomers clambering to rent one of its cute little cottages. And on sunny days, locals and visitors alike perch by their doorways to catch some rays (most often over a glass of wine).<br /><br />Happily, the ’Batter is also fast becoming one of Dublin’s most exciting foodie areas, with neighbourhood restaurants luring gourmands from all over.

Over the past year, the area has seen a wealth of positive changes: Lucky’s pub has been transformed into a cultural hotspot with excellent rotating exhibitions, while Pearse Lyons has reintroduced tours of its church distillery. Green spaces like the War Memorial Gardens or Phoenix Park mean you can twin a day vintage shopping with something more outdoorsy – or you can head straight to MVP for a pint.<br /><br />Sounds like a pretty dreamy part of the city, right? If you’re local, you may well have discovered the joys of Dublin 8 already. But for everyone else: add it to your bucket list ASAP.”<br /><br />Courtesy of https://www.timeout.com/news/dublin-8-has-been-named-one-of-the-worlds-coolest-neighbourhoods-heres-why-100621",0,1,1,Dublin City,53.33788596864669,-6.288629093937893,Private room,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,90,1,14,2,2,2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1565.0

699176365390562513,"Barrow Street, just off Sheridan Square, is a typical Greenwich Village street. Each house represents a layer of the Village's special architecture and history. A few of the buildings are a bit bedraggled; others are noble, and some are both. <br /> <br />In the late 18th century the western part of Greenwich Village, including what is now Barrow Street, was dotted with large estates. One of them, Richmond Hill, near what are now Charlton and Varick Streets, was owned for several years by Aaron Burr -- around the time of the 1804 duel in which he killed Alexander Hamilton. <br /> <br />Barrow Street may have been named for Thomas Barrow, an artist, but it is unclear when this part of the street got its name. The oldest remaining house on the street is No. 25, built in 1826. Other houses followed, and by 1850 the street was almost completely built up.",0,1,0,Dublin City,53.34158106938076,-6.237362228920931,Entire home/apt,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,260,2,1125,1,1,1,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,26.0
